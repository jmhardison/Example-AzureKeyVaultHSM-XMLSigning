# Example Azure KeyVault HMS Protected Key XML Document Signing

This project is an example, correction... ugly example, of how to sign XML Documents using keys that are stored in Azure KeyVault HSM.
In this model, your private key is non-exportable from Azure KeyVault, and requires you to ship a hash for signing.

More information will be added in a future commit documented the use.
